<P>NASA and the entire scientific community will document and review the data collected by the astronauts on the Moon in real time. NASA flight controllers and members of the larger scientific community will be able to communicate and share notes on data collected during a lunar trip as part of an app we're developing. In addition to the post-mission operations debriefs and scientific research, many people on Earth will be active in documenting and reviewing this information in real time. The present record-keeping method for human spaceflight involves each member of the flight control team creating and maintaining a console log that records the data required to fulfill his or her job responsibilities.. A copy of the mission's console log is kept as proof of progress. Each member of the flight control team creates an individual console log while using the current system. A flight controller can't see the logs of others as they're being created in real time or synchronize their own and others' logs so they can compare notes during or after a mission. As a result, for astronauts and scientists alike, our project is critical.</P>
